# Air Quality Vizalization Tool

Creating a a visualization tool would to communicate their findings would open the gateway to new discussions to take place. The tool should:
1. Vizualize the spatial distribution of PM2.5 in the air across Almaty
2. Clearly show the relation between coal consumption and air quality
3. Enable interactivity when exploring data

Geospatioal analysis allows to effectively show how air quality is compromised nearby the power plants. Using interpolation methods would allow to get a general idea about the air quality across the city.

Presenting the data in a time-series plot will clearly show seasonal trends and correlations in data. This will help activists to advocate for policy changes and general public awareness.
